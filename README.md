# Tic Tac Toe
It's a basic tic tac toe game and it's played with two people. You can play it now via [live demo](https://tictactoexox.netlify.app/)

One player determines where to put the "x" marks and other player determines where to put the "o" marks.

The player who manages to put three of the marks verticaly or straight without being prevented by the other player gains one point.

If there is no field left on the game board and neither of the players manage to gain a score, board will reset automaticly.
